 AI-Assisted Features

This project includes an AI component that assists users in better understanding and managing their expenses.  
The AI does not replace the core system but enhances it with intelligent insights.

1. Auto Expense Categorization
Users often enter unclear expense descriptions (e.g., "Shoprite 4k").  
The system sends these descriptions to a Large Language Model (LLM), which classifies them into predefined categories such as:

- Groceries
- Transport
- Utilities
- Eating Out
- Entertainment
- Shopping
- Other

This reduces manual effort and improves accuracy.

2. Spending Insights & Suggestions
Based on aggregated expense data, the AI analyzes spending patterns and generates simple, natural-language suggestions to help users reduce unnecessary spending.

Example insights include:
- Identifying high spending categories
- Suggesting cost-cutting habits
- Encouraging better budgeting behavior

 Prompt Management
AI prompts are stored separately to allow easy updates and improvements without changing application logic.  
This approach supports better prompt engineering and maintainability.
